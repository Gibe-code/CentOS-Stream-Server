## Introduction  
**Background**  

CentOS Stream Server is a Linux-based operating system developed as a continuously delivered distribution that sits between Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) in the RHEL development process. It is maintained by the CentOS Project and backed by Red Hat.
CentOS Stream was introduced in 2019 as a rolling-release version of CentOS that tracks just ahead of a current RHEL release. This makes it particularly suitable for developers and system administrators who want to see what is coming in future versions of RHEL and contribute feedback upstream.
CentOS Stream Server is ideal for enterprise-grade applications, server hosting, and cloud infrastructure. It provides a stable, reliable, and secure platform that benefits from Red Hat‚Äôs development pipeline while also offering early access to updates and features. Its growing community and strong support for enterprise workloads make it a valuable tool in both educational and professional environments.  

## Motivation
My motivation for exploring CentOS Stream Server comes from its critical role in bridging the gap between upstream innovation and downstream stability in enterprise Linux systems. As the backbone of many production environments, understanding how CentOS Stream fits into the Red Hat ecosystem is valuable for anyone pursuing a career in systems administration, DevOps, or enterprise IT infrastructure.
CentOS Stream offers a unique opportunity to observe and interact with the development process of RHEL, providing insight into how features are integrated, tested, and stabilized. This makes it an excellent platform for learning about modern Linux server management, system updates, and deployment pipelines in a real-world context. Through this documentation, I hope to deepen my knowledge of enterprise-grade operating systems and better appreciate the workflow behind reliable Linux distributions.

## Issues

**üîß Problems Faced During Installation**

1. **Virtual Machine Display Resolution**  
   After installation, the CentOS Stream Server VM was stuck at a low resolution (1024x768) and did not resize automatically with the VirtualBox window. Full-screen mode also did not scale properly.

2. **Guest Additions Installation Failure**  
   Initial attempts to install VirtualBox Guest Additions failed due to missing kernel headers and development tools (`kernel-devel`, `gcc`, etc.), which are required for compiling kernel modules.

3. **Network Configuration Issues**  
   Although the network adapter appeared as connected in VirtualBox, the VM had no internet access due to incorrect network adapter settings (NAT vs. Bridged Mode mismatch).

4. **Software Package Download Errors**  
   During installation or update attempts, some packages failed to download due to mirror selection issues or DNS resolution failures, which interrupted the installation process.

5. **Partitioning Confusion**  
   During the manual partitioning step, some options (like setting up a custom LVM or separate `/home`) were not intuitive for beginners and could easily lead to partitioning errors.


## Solutions  
**Resolving Installation Issues**  
**1.	Virtual Machine Display Resolution**  
To fix the display issue, VirtualBox Guest Additions were installed after installing the necessary kernel packages. The following commands were run inside the CentOS VM:
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"  
sudo dnf install kernel-headers kernel-devel elfutils-libelf-devel  

Then, the Guest Additions ISO was mounted via the VirtualBox menu, and the script VBoxLinuxAdditions.run was executed:  
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run  

After a reboot, dynamic resolution adjustment and full-screen mode worked correctly.  

**2.	Guest Additions Installation Failure**  
As above, the issue was resolved by ensuring all development tools and kernel headers were installed before running the Guest Additions script. It's important to match the installed kernel version with the kernel-devel package.  

**3.	Network Configuration Issues**  
The network issue was resolved by switching the VirtualBox adapter setting from NAT to Bridged Adapter, which allowed the VM to directly access the host network.  
 Additionally, DNS settings were verified using:  
cat /etc/resolv.conf  

and manually updated if necessary.  

**4.	Software Package Download Errors**  
These were resolved by switching to more reliable mirrors. Running the following command helped refresh repositories:  
sudo dnf clean all  
sudo dnf makecache  

Also, temporarily switching to a different mirror list in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory helped bypass connectivity issues.  

**5.	Partitioning Confusion**  
To avoid manual errors, the automatic partitioning option was selected during installation. For users wanting custom partitions, official CentOS documentation was referenced for guidance on using LVM and creating /home, /var, and /boot partitions  

   
   
 
## Filesystem  
**CentOS Stream Server Filesystem**  
By default, CentOS Stream Server uses the ext4 (Fourth Extended Filesystem) as its primary filesystem during installation. It is selected for its balance between stability, performance, and compatibility. Ext4 supports large volumes and files, journaling, and backward compatibility with ext3/ext2.  
**‚Ä¢	Default:** ext4  
**‚Ä¢	Why ext4:** It is mature, well-supported, has good performance, and is reliable for server environments.  

**Other Supported Filesystems**  

CentOS Stream also supports several other filesystems that can be configured manually or during advanced installations: 

**‚Ä¢	XFS:**  
o	Default for many RHEL/CentOS setups on enterprise-grade systems.  
o	High performance and excellent for handling large files and parallel I/O.  
o	Chosen in many server environments.  

**‚Ä¢	Btrfs** (via external repo or manual install):  
o	Modern filesystem with snapshot and subvolume support, but not officially supported by RHEL-based production environments.  
o	Suitable for experimentation.  

**‚Ä¢	vfat/FAT32:**  
o	Used for EFI boot partitions.  
o	Provides cross-platform compatibility.  

**‚Ä¢	NTFS (via ntfs-3g):**  
o	Read/write support available through additional packages.  
o	Used mostly for interoperability with Windows-formatted drives.  

**‚Ä¢	exFAT:**  
o	Supported via external packages.  
o	Useful for USB drives, but not recommended for system partitions.  

**‚Ä¢	ZFS:**  
o	Can be installed manually but not officially supported by CentOS/RHEL.  
o	Advanced features like data integrity verification and built-in RAID.  

**Conclusion on Filesystem Usage**  
For most CentOS Stream Server installations, XFS is typically the default and preferred option in enterprise environments due to its scalability and performance, although ext4 remains a solid choice for general use, especially in virtualized environments.

## Virtualization in Modern Operating Systems   
**What is Virtualization?**  

Virtualization is the process of creating a **virtual version of computing resources**, such as operating systems, servers, storage devices, or networks, by abstracting the hardware through software. In simpler terms, it allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical system, each operating as if it were a separate, independent machine. Each virtual machine operates with its own **virtual CPU, memory, disk, and network interface**, all managed by a hypervisor, which serves as the intermediary between the host hardware and the guest systems.  
 
**Why Virtualization Matters?**  

Virtualization plays a critical role in modern IT infrastructure for several reasons:  

**1.	Resource Optimization:**  
It allows organizations to maximize the use of physical hardware by running multiple VMs on a single server, reducing waste and lowering costs.

**2.	Isolation and Security:**  
Virtual machines are isolated from one another, which improves system security and stability. A failure or attack on one VM does not affect others.

**3.	Scalability and Flexibility:**  
Virtual environments can be quickly scaled up or down based on demand. New VMs can be provisioned in minutes without needing new physical machines.

**4.	Testing and Development:**  
Developers can use virtualization to test applications across multiple OS environments without needing separate physical systems.

**5.	Disaster Recovery and Backup:**  
Virtual machines can be easily backed up and restored. Snapshots allow system states to be saved and reverted if needed.

**6.	Cloud Computing Foundation:**  
Virtualization is a key enabler of cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) that offer Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
 
**How Virtualization Works?**  

Virtualization is made possible through a key component known as the **hypervisor**, which manages and allocates hardware resources to VMs. There are two main types of hypervisors:  

**‚Ä¢	Type 1 (Bare-metal Hypervisor):**  
Runs directly on the host hardware. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM. These offer high performance and are used in enterprise environments.

**‚Ä¢	Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisor):**  
Runs on top of a host operating system. Examples include VMware Workstation and Oracle VM VirtualBox. These are typically used for personal or development environments.

Here's how virtualization works step by step:  
1.	The hypervisor creates a virtual layer over the hardware.  
2.	This layer simulates virtual hardware components (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).  
3.	Guest operating systems (like CentOS, Ubuntu, or Windows) are installed on these virtual machines as if they were running on physical machines.  
4.	The hypervisor manages scheduling, I/O requests, and memory allocation across the VMs.  
Advanced features like **hardware-assisted virtualization** (Intel VT-x, AMD-V) enhance performance by allowing the guest OS to run closer to native speeds.  
 
 
**Virtualization in CentOS Stream Server Context**  

CentOS Stream Server plays a significant role in virtualization environments, particularly for developers, sysadmins, and enterprises working within or alongside the Red Hat ecosystem. Its rolling-release nature makes it a **forward-looking platform** ideal for testing, building, and managing virtualized systems that will align with future RHEL versions.

**Virtualization Support in CentOS Stream**  

CentOS Stream comes equipped with robust support for virtualization technologies out of the box, including:  

**‚Ä¢	KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)**  
‚Äì A full virtualization solution built into the Linux kernel, allowing CentOS to act as both a host and a guest operating system.

**‚Ä¢	QEMU**  
‚Äì Works with KVM to provide hardware emulation and device passthrough.

**‚Ä¢	libvirt**  
‚Äì A powerful toolkit and API used to manage KVM/QEMU virtual machines through command-line tools (virsh) or graphical interfaces like virt-manager.

**‚Ä¢	VirtIO Drivers**  
‚Äì Provides high-performance I/O for virtual disks and network interfaces.

**‚Ä¢	Cockpit**  
‚Äì A web-based GUI that includes modules for managing virtual machines on CentOS Stream, making it more accessible for those less comfortable with command-line management.

**Use Cases in CentOS Stream**  

**1.	Development & Testing:**  
Developers use CentOS Stream to build and test virtualized applications or services intended for future RHEL systems, ensuring compatibility and readiness.

**2.	Private Clouds:**  
CentOS Stream is often used as the base OS in virtualization clusters running tools like oVirt, OpenStack, or Proxmox due to its upstream alignment with RHEL.

**3.	Nested Virtualization:**  
CentOS Stream supports running VMs inside other VMs, which is useful for training, simulation, or advanced CI/CD pipelines.

**4.	Containerization Support:**  
While not virtualization in the traditional sense, CentOS Stream offers native tools like Podman and Buildah for lightweight, OS-level virtualization alternatives to full VMs.

**Advantages of Using CentOS Stream for Virtualization**  

**‚Ä¢	Stability with Innovation:** You get access to near-future RHEL updates in a stable form.  
**‚Ä¢	Enterprise-grade Tooling:** Features like SELinux, systemd, and advanced networking (bridges, bonds, VLANs) are supported and production-ready.  
**‚Ä¢	Community and Vendor Alignment:** Since CentOS Stream feeds into RHEL, it allows for contributions and testing that may directly impact the future of enterprise Linux.
